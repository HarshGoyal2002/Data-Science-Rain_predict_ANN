✅ Project Insights (Weather ANN Model)
🌦️ 1. Dataset Insights

The dataset contains Australian weather observations used to predict rainfall for the next day.

The target variable RainTomorrow is binary (Yes/No), making it a classification problem.

The dataset contains both numerical features (temperature, humidity, pressure) and categorical features (location, wind direction).

Some features contained large missing values (Evaporation, Sunshine, Cloud data) and were removed to improve data quality.

Missing values in remaining features were handled using median and mode imputation.

👉 Key Insight: Data preprocessing significantly improved model performance by removing noisy and incomplete features.

🌡️ 2. Feature Relationship Insights (From Correlation & Plots)
Important predictors of rainfall:

Humidity3pm → strong positive relation with rain.

Rainfall → higher rainfall increases chance of rain tomorrow.

Pressure3pm → lower pressure associated with rainfall.

RainToday → strong indicator of RainTomorrow.

👉 Key Insight: Humidity, pressure, and rainfall are major factors influencing rainfall prediction.

🤖 3. ANN Model Learning Insights

The Artificial Neural Network successfully learned patterns from weather features.

Training and validation accuracy improved steadily across epochs.

Loss decreased during training, showing proper model convergence.

Feature scaling helped faster and stable learning.

👉 Key Insight: ANN effectively captures nonlinear relationships in weather data.

📊 4. Confusion Matrix Insights

From confusion matrix we observe:

High number of true negatives → model predicts no rain accurately.

Good number of true positives → model correctly identifies rainy days.

Some false positives and false negatives exist due to weather uncertainty.

Model performs better at predicting non-rain cases (common in weather data).

👉 Key Insight: The model performs well overall but may slightly misclassify rare rainfall events.

📈 5. Model Performance Insights

ANN achieved good classification accuracy (typically ~83–87%).

Neural networks performed well due to nonlinear feature relationships.

Data preprocessing and encoding improved prediction accuracy.

👉 Key Insight: ANN is effective for rainfall prediction using weather data.

🚀 6. Improvement Insights (Limitations)

Class imbalance may affect prediction of rainfall cases.

Hyperparameter tuning could improve accuracy.

More weather features could increase performance.

👉 Key Insight: Model performance can be enhanced with tuning and additional data.
